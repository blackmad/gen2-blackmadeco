- fix map design
--> figure out what it needs for yuva's map
--> get it to default to unrounded? or much less rounded?
--> why kaleido unhappy middle in map someimte

- make a more geometric-intersecting shape design like https://www.pinterest.com/pin/658440408009961386/

- make colTileBoundary be a number

- bring back breakThePlane

- redo mondrian grid to be on an actual grid

- zero eslint errors
- zero eslint warnings

- try to implement something (map?) as potrace (reuse blobs?)

- implement posture collar
- implement cuffs
- implement sacred geometry
- implement multi-row/multi-column
- dive deeper into tiling designs

- spelunk and document and uncouple how params are passed around

- do crazy typesafe stuff


- why are the holes and boundaries on this model slightly not symmetrical http://localhost:8080/StraightCuffOuter/StraightCuffOuter/InnerDesignSnowflake#StraightCuffOuter.height%3D2&StraightCuffOuter.wristCircumference%3D6.9&StraightCuffOuter.forearmCircumference%3D7.2&InnerDesignSnowflake.debug%3Dfalse&InnerDesignSnowflake.safeBorderWidth%3D0.25&InnerDesignSnowflake.seed%3D1&InnerDesignSnowflake.numPoints%3D20&InnerDesignSnowflake.numBorderPoints%3D0&InnerDesignSnowflake.borderSize%3D0.1&InnerDesignSnowflake.rows%3D1&InnerDesignSnowflake.cols%3D1&InnerDesignSnowflake.mirror%3Dtrue&InnerDesignSnowflake.voronoi%3Dtrue&InnerDesignSnowflake.removeEdgePolygons%3Dfalse&InnerDesignSnowflake.kaleido%3Dtrue&InnerDesignSnowflake.segmentBuffer%3D0&InnerDesignSnowflake.segments%3D2&InnerDesignSnowflake.shouldSmooth%3Dtrue&InnerDesignSnowflake.smoothingFactor%3D0.8&InnerDesignSnowflake.breakThePlane%3Dfalse&InnerDesignSnowflake.extendOutward%3D0.25&InnerDesignSnowflake.concavity%3D0.4&InnerDesignSnowflake.lengthThreshold%3D0.25&InnerDesignSnowflake.outlineSize%3D0.15
