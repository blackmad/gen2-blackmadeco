FONT
- increase kerning

MAP
- keep trying to do something cool for 

TRACE
- option to delete points with too acute angle

SVG export
- fix fill

SACRED GEOMETRY
- make it work at all in cuff mode

- add a way to flip holes to engraves

- fix break-the-plane on voronoi


- fix map design
--> figure out what it needs for yuva's map
--> get it to default to unrounded? or much less rounded?
--> why kaleido unhappy middle in map someimte

TRACE
- fix the offset of the repeat for centering
- document some of these
- remove unneeded inner holes

- fix back/forward navigation in the app

- bring back fillColor in App - it confused lightburn. it should be getting cleared in cleanSVGForDownload but it's not

- make a more geometric-intersecting shape design like https://www.pinterest.com/pin/658440408009961386/


- bring back breakThePlane

- redo mondrian grid to be on an actual grid

- zero eslint errors
- zero eslint warnings

- try to implement something (map?) as potrace (reuse blobs?)

- implement posture collar
- implement cuffs
- implement sacred geometry
- implement multi-row/multi-column
- dive deeper into tiling designs

- spelunk and document and uncouple how params are passed around

- do crazy typesafe stuff

- so an overall problem with the code coupling is how boundaryModel sometimes means the area to draw in and sometimes means the outer bounds

- would so love to have some designs that do more curving
- would so love to have some designs that do more organic stuff
- would so love to have some designs that do more brocade stuff
