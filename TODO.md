TRACE
- why is contain broken at first
- why are some paths unable to heal?
- fix how it seralizes url
- remove unneeded inner holes
- add a repeat option
- document some of these

- bring back break the plane

- fix map design
--> figure out what it needs for yuva's map
--> get it to default to unrounded? or much less rounded?
--> why kaleido unhappy middle in map someimte
--> why is this not going to edge http://localhost:8080/BoxOuter/InnerDesignMap#BoxOuter.height%3D3&BoxOuter.topWidth%3D3&BoxOuter.bottomWidth%3D3&BoxOuter.smoothingFactor%3D0&InnerDesignMap.debug%3Dfalse&InnerDesignMap.safeBorderWidth%3D0&InnerDesignMap.center%3D35.0688889%2C-106.58329&InnerDesignMap.scaleX%3D240&InnerDesignMap.xyRatio%3D1&InnerDesignMap.lineWidth%3D0.1&InnerDesignMap.invertLatLng%3Dfalse&InnerDesignMap.centerAt%3Dcenter&InnerDesignMap.kaleido%3Dtrue&InnerDesignMap.segmentBuffer%3D0&InnerDesignMap.segments%3D10&InnerDesignMap.shouldSmooth%3Dtrue&InnerDesignMap.smoothingFactor%3D0.8&InnerDesignMap.breakThePlane%3Dfalse&InnerDesignMap.extendOutward%3D0.25&InnerDesignMap.concavity%3D0.4&InnerDesignMap.lengthThreshold%3D0.25&InnerDesignMap.outlineSize%3D0.15&InnerDesignMap.safeCone%3DPath%20%40152530&InnerDesignMap.outerModel%3DPath%20%40152544&InnerDesignMap.boundaryModel%3DPath%20%40152542&InnerDesignMap.center.0%3D4&InnerDesignMap.center.1%3D0&InnerDesignMap.center.2%3D.&InnerDesignMap.center.3%3D7&InnerDesignMap.center.4%3D4&InnerDesignMap.center.5%3D%2C&InnerDesignMap.center.6%3D-&InnerDesignMap.center.7%3D7&InnerDesignMap.center.8%3D4

- make a more geometric-intersecting shape design like https://www.pinterest.com/pin/658440408009961386/

- make colTileBoundary be a number

- bring back breakThePlane

- redo mondrian grid to be on an actual grid

- zero eslint errors
- zero eslint warnings

- try to implement something (map?) as potrace (reuse blobs?)

- implement posture collar
- implement cuffs
- implement sacred geometry
- implement multi-row/multi-column
- dive deeper into tiling designs

- spelunk and document and uncouple how params are passed around

- do crazy typesafe stuff

- would so love to have some designs that do more curving
- would so love to have some designs that do more organic stuff
- would so love to have some designs that do more brocade stuff


- why are the holes and boundaries on this model slightly not symmetrical http://localhost:8080/StraightCuffOuter/StraightCuffOuter/InnerDesignSnowflake#StraightCuffOuter.height%3D2&StraightCuffOuter.wristCircumference%3D6.9&StraightCuffOuter.forearmCircumference%3D7.2&InnerDesignSnowflake.debug%3Dfalse&InnerDesignSnowflake.safeBorderWidth%3D0.25&InnerDesignSnowflake.seed%3D1&InnerDesignSnowflake.numPoints%3D20&InnerDesignSnowflake.numBorderPoints%3D0&InnerDesignSnowflake.borderSize%3D0.1&InnerDesignSnowflake.rows%3D1&InnerDesignSnowflake.cols%3D1&InnerDesignSnowflake.mirror%3Dtrue&InnerDesignSnowflake.voronoi%3Dtrue&InnerDesignSnowflake.removeEdgePolygons%3Dfalse&InnerDesignSnowflake.kaleido%3Dtrue&InnerDesignSnowflake.segmentBuffer%3D0&InnerDesignSnowflake.segments%3D2&InnerDesignSnowflake.shouldSmooth%3Dtrue&InnerDesignSnowflake.smoothingFactor%3D0.8&InnerDesignSnowflake.breakThePlane%3Dfalse&InnerDesignSnowflake.extendOutward%3D0.25&InnerDesignSnowflake.concavity%3D0.4&InnerDesignSnowflake.lengthThreshold%3D0.25&InnerDesignSnowflake.outlineSize%3D0.15
