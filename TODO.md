- fix safeCone on straight cuff

- fix map design
--> figure out what it needs for yuva's map
--> get it to default to unrounded? or much less rounded?
--> why kaleido unhappy middle in map someimte

- voronoi still not going to the bottom1!!!!!

TRACE
- why are some paths unable to heal?
- add a repeat option
- document some of these
- remove unneeded inner holes


- bring back break the plane

- make a more geometric-intersecting shape design like https://www.pinterest.com/pin/658440408009961386/

- make colTileBoundary be a number

- bring back breakThePlane

- redo mondrian grid to be on an actual grid

- zero eslint errors
- zero eslint warnings

- try to implement something (map?) as potrace (reuse blobs?)

- implement posture collar
- implement cuffs
- implement sacred geometry
- implement multi-row/multi-column
- dive deeper into tiling designs

- spelunk and document and uncouple how params are passed around

- do crazy typesafe stuff

- so an overall problem with the code coupling is how boundaryModel sometimes means the area to draw in and sometimes means the outer bounds

- would so love to have some designs that do more curving
- would so love to have some designs that do more organic stuff
- would so love to have some designs that do more brocade stuff
